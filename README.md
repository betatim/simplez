simplez
=======

The pelican theme used on [betatim.github.io](http://betatim.github.io).
Aim is to keep things simple. Uses Bootstrap 3.

Currently it is extremely specific to my needs, but feel free to fork it!

Installation
============

First:

`git clone https://github.com/betatim/simplez.git`

Then:

Point the `THEME` variable in your `pelicanconf.py` to `/path/to/simplez`
